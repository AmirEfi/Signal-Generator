# Signal-Generator
## Final Project of Microprocessor course - Spring 2023

This project creates 6 types of signals: Sin / |Sin| / Square / Triangle / Sawtooth / Step

First, the menu will be shown to the user then the user inputs a number between 1 to 6.

After that, the user determines the frequency and time to show the signal; finally, the selected signal will be delivered to the oscilloscope.
